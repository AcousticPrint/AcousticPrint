## Introduction


1)DS1:Experimentally collected acoustic signals for five different classes of drones, rangingfrom amateur to professional drones,Parrot Bebop 2,DJI MavicPro,DJI Phantom4 Advanced,DJI Spark,DJI Matrice 100; 
2)DS2:Scraped audio profiles from YouTube videos traces forAutel EVO,DJI Inspire2,JME, andDJI MavicAir. 
3)DS3:We considered acousticprofiles of 4 non-drones that are in theKUclass. We experimentallycollected the acoustic samples ofCalm Environmentand samplesof other 3 classes in KU were scraped from 3 different YouTubevideos each to be used intraining,validation, andtesting. 
4)DS4:We downloaded acoustic signals that consist of various mechanicalsignals generated by vehicles and the drones that were not usedin training.1We considered 10s of samples for each class and usedthem in testing only. We make our datasets available to the publicwhich can found in
